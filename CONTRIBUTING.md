# Contributing

You can contribute in one of three ways:

* Provide your own receipts
* Request features/report bugs
* Implement features/fix bugs/add tests

All kinds of contributions are welcome.

## Providing receipts

If you want to ensure your receipts can be processed by this library, you can provide one or more of your own receipts
so they are part of our testing infrastructure.

Example receipts, that are tested automatically, are located under: [`test/Examples/`](./test/Examples)

To do add yours, either:

* [fork the repository], add your PDF(s) to the `Examples` directory, and [open a PR]
* [open an issue] and attach your receipt as a file
